          Our team was initially made up of four individuals, all with diverse skillsets and experience, and we decided to use each person's unique skills for the team project.
Our first Zoom meeting took place on Friday the 7th of May 2021, with the minutes for that meeting and all the subsequent weekly meetings here (link). We had to develop and agree on a team project contract with assigned roles and discuss an approach to the initial project planning. We needed as a team to establish early on roles and responsibilities. Establishing the teams' positions would then ensure clear demarcation points for the various team members on their responsibilities and accountabilities. The team selected these roles and obligations from the first meeting and understood each member's strengths.
 This understanding of the individual's roles enabled the team to work effectively where each member knew their role, which then created flexibility as the demands on the team changed through the module. Although the team did work very effectively, we could have looked forward more to work required at the end of the course and prepared weeks earlier. 
From the initial meeting, I took on a few weekly tasks within my sphere of accountability to create and set up a Kanban board on Trello and keep it updated weekly and set up the weekly Zoom team calls. We decided to rotate the chair and minute-taker in the team meetings, which I felt kept everyone actively involved. 
We had another member join our team in week three; because we already had roles and responsibilities established, it made it easier for him to move into the group without any friction and take up his position and responsibilities.
The team's main task for the module was to set up a website that could then be security tested by another team utilising penetration testing tools, and our team would carry out the same testing on their site. Initially, there were several problems in getting a website established with each of us taking an action to set up our websites, the most successful in being used as the team website.  To deal with the complexities of setting up the website, two specific members who had more experience in this area took the lead and got one website up and running, ready for testing by the other team. The same two members took the technical lead in carrying out the other team's site penetration testing utilising the tools required, which are listed here (link).  There was some cross-training so that the whole team could be involved in the penetration testing with the results listed here (link). Due to the team working well together and the cross-training involved, all team members could be part of the testing phase.
During the whole module there was a requirement to produce seminar slides and contribute to the
